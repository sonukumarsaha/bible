                                                      Holy Scripture tells us that Bartimaeus was blind, and when
                                                      Jesus was leaving Jericho, His disciples and a large crowd
                                                      were with Him. This makes it clear how difficult it must
                                                      have been for a blind man to raise his voice and reach Jesus
                                                      amidst the crowd. He could have pleaded with someone nearby
                                                      to convey his voice to Jesus or requested some people to
                                                      take him to Jesus. But he did not do so. Instead, he started
                                                      calling out to Jesus, regardless of the crowd.</span></p>

                                                      should learn from this that bringing our troubles before
                                                      Jesus is our own responsibility. If we depend on people, not
                                                      only will they fail to help us, but time will also pass
                                                      by.</span></p>

                                                      would have happened if Bartimaeus had asked for help instead
                                                      of calling out himself? Would people in such a large crowd
                                                      really leave their opportunity to see Jesus and help a blind
                                                      man? Even if some were willing to assist, it is likely that
                                                      by the time they brought Bartimaeus to Jesus, He would have
                                                      already moved on. As a result, Bartimaeus&rsquo; suffering
                                                      would have remained unchanged.</span></p>

                                                      same happens with us. When we face problems, we go to a
                                                      pastor or fellow believers for prayer, but we hesitate to
                                                      present our sorrow directly before God. We should first call
                                                      upon Jesus ourselves.</span></p><br>

                                                      when we try to draw near to the Lord, the world attempts to
                                                      stop us. Sometimes, even our own family becomes an obstacle.
                                                      Due to this pressure, we stop calling out to Jesus. The same
                                                      happened with Bartimaeus. When he started calling out,
                                                      people rebuked him, asking him to be silent. But he did not
                                                      give up; instead, he called out even louder.</span></p>
                                          <p style="text-align: justify;"><span
                                                      style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Dear
                                                      brothers and sisters, in the beginning, we are also
                                                      suppressed so that we do not move forward in the Lord. But
                                                      this is not the time to step back by listening to
                                                      people&rsquo;s words. Instead, we should move forward with
                                                      even greater faith and holiness. Just as Bartimaeus did not
                                                      stop calling out despite being rebuked, we too should keep
                                                      trying until we receive an answer. Ultimately, his
                                                      persistence paid off, and Jesus called him near.</span></p><br>

                                                      would not have thrown away his garment. But as soon as Jesus
                                                      called him, the first thing he did was cast aside his old
                                                      garments. This signifies that he had complete faith that he

                                                      Yes, we all have many old garments that we need to
                                                      discard&mdash;our bad habits, sources of sin, and countless
                                                      reasons that lead us to wrongdoing. If we have placed our
                                                      faith in Jesus, we must abandon all our sins; otherwise, we

                                                      we let go of all these burdens, we prove by our actions that
                                                      our faith in Jesus is unwavering. This is what pleases our

                                                      believe that Jesus can solve all our problems, then we must

                                                      when praying, instead of listing our problems, we should

                                                      Bartimaeus received his sight, Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go,

                                                      have returned home. But he did not. Instead, he used his new
                                                      vision not to see the world, but to follow Jesus.</span></p>

                                                      teaches us an important lesson: even when our prayers are
                                                      answered, we should remain as faithful to the Lord as we
