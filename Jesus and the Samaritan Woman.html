                                    And Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. So Jesus, being weary from His journey, sat down
                                    by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water.
                                    Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Give me a drink.&rdquo; 8 (For His disciples had gone into
                                    the city to buy food.) 9 Then the Samaritan woman said to Him, &ldquo;How is it that
                                    You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?&rdquo; (For Jews have
                                    no dealings with Samaritans.) 10 Jesus answered her, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of
                                    God, and who it is that says to you, &lsquo;Give me a drink,&rsquo; you would have
                                    asked Him, and He would have given you living water.&rdquo; 11 The woman said to
                                    Him, &ldquo;Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do
                                    You get that living water? 12 Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us
                                    this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?&rdquo; 13
                                    Jesus answered, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,</span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;"><br></span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">&nbsp;14 but whoever drinks
                                    of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall
                                    give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting
                                    life.&rdquo; 15 The woman said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water so that I may
                                    not thirst, nor come here to draw.&rdquo; 16 Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Go, call your
                                    husband, and come here.&rdquo;</span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;"><br></span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">&nbsp;17 The woman answered,
                                    &ldquo;I have no husband.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;You have well said,
                                    &lsquo;I have no husband.&rsquo; 18 For you have had five husbands, and the one you
                                    now have is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly.&rdquo; 19 The woman
                                    said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. 20 Our fathers worshiped
                                    on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to
                                    worship.&rdquo; 21 Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming
                                    when you will neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father. 22 You
                                    worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is from the
                                    Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when true worshipers will worship the
                                    Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such to worship
                                    Him.</span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;"><br></span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">&nbsp;24 God is Spirit, and
                                    those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&rdquo; 25 The woman said to
                                    Him, &ldquo;I know that Messiah is coming&rdquo; (who is called Christ). &ldquo;When
                                    He comes, He will tell us all things.&rdquo; 26 Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I who
                                    speak to you am He.&rdquo; 27 Just then His disciples came back, and they marveled
                                    that He was talking with a woman. Yet no one said, &ldquo;What do You seek?&rdquo;
                                    or, &ldquo;Why are You talking with her?&rdquo; 28 The woman then left her water
                                    jar, went into the city, and said to the people, 29 &ldquo;Come, see a Man who told
                                    me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?&rdquo; 39 Many of the Samaritans
                                    from that town believed in Him because of the woman&rsquo;s testimony, &ldquo;He
                                    told me everything I ever did.&rdquo; 41 And because of His words, many more became
                                    believers. 42 They said to the woman, &ldquo;Now we believe not just because of what
                                    you said, but because we ourselves have heard Him, and we know that this Man truly
                                    is the Savior of the world.&rdquo;</span></p>

                                          style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Jesus said to her,

                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">&nbsp;(John 4:7)</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Why
                                    did Jesus directly say, &quot;Give me a drink&quot; to the Samaritan
                                    woman?</span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;"><br></span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Normally, when we ask
                                    something from a stranger, we first introduce ourselves, inquire about the other
                                    person, and then make our request. But Jesus did not do that. He did not introduce
                                    Himself but went straight to the point.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Why
                                    did Jesus do this, and what should we learn from it? We will explore this further,
                                    along with verses 6 and 8.</span></p>
                        <br> <br>

                                          style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">The Samaritan woman
                                          asked, &ldquo;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a
                                          Samaritan woman?&rdquo;</span></strong><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">&nbsp;(John 4:9)</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">It
                                    is clear that Jews and Samaritans had no dealings with each other. Yet, Jesus not
                                    only spoke to her but also asked for water.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Through this, He taught us
                                    that we should also communicate with those with whom we have had no prior
                                    connection.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Why
                                    did Jesus give this message? We will discuss this in detail further.</span></p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span
                                          style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Jesus answered,
                                          &quot;If you knew the gift of God and who it is that says to you, &lsquo;Give
                                          me a drink,&rsquo; you would have asked Him, and He would have given you
                                          living water.&quot;</span></strong><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">&nbsp;(John 4:10)</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Notice that Jesus answered
                                    this Samaritan woman, whereas there were times when He remained silent when people
                                    accused Him&mdash;calling Him a deceiver or claiming He healed by the power of
                                    demons.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">The
                                    reason was that this answer was going to bring salvation to the woman&rsquo;s life.
                                    But if He had responded to those who questioned Him only to test and oppose Him, it
                                    would have only made them angrier.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">From this, we learn that we
                                    should only respond when it leads to someone&rsquo;s salvation or opens the way to
                                    truth. If answering only leads to arguments, it is better to remain silent, no
                                    matter how serious the accusations against us.</span></p>

                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Jesus said, &quot;If you knew
                                    the gift of God,&quot; meaning that the Samaritan woman was unaware of God&rsquo;s
                                    law and His will. Yet, Jesus took time to speak to her. This proves that Jesus did
                                    not come only for the Jews but for the salvation of all humanity.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Jesus first spoke about the
                                    gift of God and then said, &quot;If you also knew who it is that asks you for water,
                                    you would have asked Him.&quot;</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Why
                                    did Jesus mention God&rsquo;s gift first and then speak about Himself?</span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;"><br></span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">&nbsp;Because knowing
                                    God&apos;s gift without accepting Jesus is useless. In earlier times, knowing only
                                    God was enough, but now Jesus is the only way to the Father (John 14:6). That is why
                                    Jesus also introduced Himself, as no one can reach the Father without the
                                    Son.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Then Jesus said, &quot;If you
                                    knew, you would ask Me.&quot;</span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;"><br></span><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">&nbsp;Jesus always says,
                                    &quot;Ask, and it will be given to you&quot; (Matthew 7:7). That is why He told the
                                    woman that if she recognized Him, she would ask for living water.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Then He said, &quot;I would
                                    have given you living water.&quot;</span><span

                                    water&quot; is Jesus&rsquo; holy blood, which we drink to receive eternal life. It
                                    is the same blood that was shed on the cross for our salvation. However, when Jesus
                                    said this, His blood had not yet been shed on the cross, but He already knew it
                                    would happen. He wanted to show her the path of salvation through His words and
                                    spiritual water.</span></p>

                                    try to share the gospel with unbelievers, they often make excuses. But if they truly
                                    understood who we serve and what we can offer them, they would ask us for time
                                    instead.</span></p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Why
                                    did Jesus say this? He is all-powerful and could have given her what He was talking
                                    about without involving her husband. Then why did He ask this question?</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">In
                                    reality, the Samaritan woman was still taking Jesus&rsquo; words lightly and was
                                    unaware of His true power. But Jesus did not say, &ldquo;Look, I know
                                    everything,&rdquo; just to display His power. Instead, He asked this question so
                                    that the woman would realize her sin. Because without the acknowledgment of sin,
                                    salvation is impossible. Jesus already knew what sins she had committed.</span></p>

                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">From this act of Jesus, we
                                    should learn that if we point out someone&apos;s mistakes, our goal should not be to
                                    prove ourselves great, but to help the person recognize their sin, repent, and walk
                                    on the right path.</span></p>

                                    for us: we should not despise such women, nor differentiate between them and a
                                    religious person. Because when anyone, no matter how sinful, acknowledges their sin
                                    and comes to Christ, they become spiritually pure and righteous.</span></p>

                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">Therefore, we have no right
                                    to point fingers at such people, for even our Heavenly Father did not do so.
                                    Instead, our responsibility is to show them the path to salvation so they too may

                                    the human heart often hesitates to accept new truth because it is attached to old
                                    traditions, beliefs, and customs. But Jesus did not come merely to free us from
                                    traditions; He came to show us the way to truth and eternal life.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span
                                    style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">This teaches us that God is
                                    not confined to a place or a ritual. He seeks those who worship Him with a sincere
                                    heart. Therefore, we should be willing to accept the truth over traditions, for
                                    salvation is possible only through faith, repentance, and God&apos;s grace&mdash;not
                                    through external rituals or religious locations.</span></p>

                                    Jesus put an end to the long-standing tradition of worshiping in specific places.
                                    There would no longer be a temple, mosque, or particular location where people had

                                    is not about buildings, traditions, or external rituals, but about the sincerity of
                                    the heart and devotion of the soul. Jesus made it clear that worship is no longer
                                    about a location or a ritual but about a direct relationship with God.</span></p>

                                    why we, as Christians, take pride in our worship.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">The
                                    reason is that we truly know whom we worship. For us, worship is not just a ritual

                                    Jesus wanted, He could have said just one, but He said both because every individual
                                    experiences a moment when they turn to Jesus Christ. It is true that the time will
                                    come, but it is also true that the time is now.</span></p>

                                    opportunity for salvation and true worship is not in the distant future, but in this
                                    very moment. We should not wait for a specific time to turn to Christ; we should
                                    turn to Him now and become true worshipers who worship the Father in spirit and

                                    is also worth noting that Jesus did not just say &quot;worshipers&quot; but

                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">The

                                    God. If this were not the case, then sinful humans would have no reason to fear sin
                                    or turn away from it.</span></p>
